# Fetal-Health-Monitoring-System-ML-DL-
The Fetal Health Monitoring System is an AI-driven diagnostic tool developed to assist in evaluating the condition of a fetus during pregnancy. By analyzing either user-input clinical values or fetal images, the system predicts the risk level as Normal, Mild Risk, or Severe Risk. It integrates both machine learning and deep learning models within a Django web framework, offering a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals or users. This system utilizes key features such as fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, accelerations, decelerations, and short-term variability to make predictions. The primary goal is to provide timely and accurate fetal health assessments, supporting early intervention and improving maternal-fetal outcomes. Built with technologies like Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and HTML/CSS, the project can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or Render. This solution is especially valuable for hospitals, clinics, telemedicine services, and research applications in maternal healthcare.
